# How to contribute to OMTeaching

Contributions are primarily in the form of pull requests.
To learn more about collaboration, see the [github articles](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests).
Fork the OMTEaching repositories into your user account, create a topic branch (not master) which you make your changes in and push to your own fork.
The reason for the topic branch is to isolate your changes.
If you want to fix two different things, create two different branches to make the changes easier to review.
