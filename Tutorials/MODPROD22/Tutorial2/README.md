# FMI for Composite Modeling, Co-simulation and Model Exchange

This tutorial was held at the 16th [MODPROD Workshop on Model-Based Cyber-physical Product Development](https://modprodblog.wordpress.com/) on 1rd February 2022.

## Content
This tutorial will give an introduction to the FMI-based Co-simulation tool
[OMSimulator](https://github.com/OpenModelica/OMSimulator),
part of [OpenModelica](https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica).
In the examples the Python interface of OMSimulator is used to create first composite
models with multiple FMUs connected and to create an SSP model with OMEdit.

## How to
Open 'FMI for Composite Modeling, Co-simulation and Model Exchange.pdf' and read along.
The presentation will tell you how to install the needed software.
